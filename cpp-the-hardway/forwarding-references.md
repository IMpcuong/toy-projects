This scenario involves the rules for **forwarding references** (sometimes called universal references).
`auto&&` works similarly to template type deduction for `T&&`.

Here's the rule:

1. **If the initializer is an lvalue:** `auto` is deduced as an lvalue reference type (`T&`).
2. **If the initializer is an rvalue:** `auto` is deduced as a non-reference type (`T`).

Now, let's apply this to your case:

1. **Initializer:** You have a `const lvalue`. Let's say its type is `const int`.
2. **Is it an lvalue?** Yes.
3. **Deduce `auto`:** According to rule 1, `auto` is deduced as the lvalue reference type corresponding to the initializer.
  Since the initializer's type is `const int`, `auto` is deduced as `const int&`.
4. **Determine the type of `x`:** The declaration is `auto&& x`. Substitute the deduced type for `auto`:
`(const int&) && x`
5.  **Apply Reference Collapsing:** C++ has rules for reference collapsing:
* `T& &` -> `T&`
* `T& &&` -> `T&`
* `T&& &` -> `T&`
* `T&& &&` -> `T&&`
6. **Final Type of `x`:** The type `(const int&) &&` collapses to `const int&`.

In our case, we have `(const int&) &&`. This matches the second rule (`T& &&` -> `T&`), where `T` is `const int`.

**Conclusion:**

When `auto&& x` is initialized with a `const lvalue` of type `const T`, the variable `x` will have the type **`const T&`**
(a const lvalue reference).
It correctly preserves the constness and lvalue-ness of the initializer.

**Example:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits> // For is_same_v

int main()
{
  const int my_const_value = 42; // my_const_value is a const lvalue

  auto&& x = my_const_value;

  // Verify the type of x
  static_assert(std::is_lvalue_reference_v<decltype(x)>, "x should be an lvalue reference");
  static_assert(std::is_const_v<std::remove_reference_t<decltype(x)>>, "x should refer to const");
  static_assert(std::is_same_v<decltype(x), const int&>, "Type of x should be const int&");

  std::cout << "my_const_value address: " << &my_const_value << std::endl;
  std::cout << "x refers to address:  " << &x << std::endl; // Same address
  std::cout << "Value via x: " << x << std::endl;

  // x = 100; // COMPILER ERROR: cannot assign to variable with const-qualified type 'const int &'

  return 0;
}
```

In this example, `auto` is deduced as `const int&`, and `x` becomes a `const int&`, correctly binding to the original `my_const_value` while respecting its constness.
